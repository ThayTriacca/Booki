# About the project

In Project #2 of the Web Developer course at OpenClassrooms, I created a responsive website. Booki is a small company that offers a user-friendly holiday planning tool. The website allows users to easily find accommodation and activities in their chosen town. With convenient filtering options, users can refine their search based on factors such as budget and atmosphere.


## Objective

- Cutting and integrating a design mockup
- Translating the mockup into web languages, specifically HTML and CSS
- Creating a responsive website that functions seamlessly across devices without compromising readability and loading speed
- Validating the code according to W3C standards for both HTML and CSS
- Practicing the flexbox technique
- Utilizing CSS selectors and HTML tags
- Using cards and background images in the project
- Incorporating Font Awesome icons
- Creating a navigation bar using an unordered list
